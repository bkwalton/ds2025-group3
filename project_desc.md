# Course Prompt

## Objective
Build the time series forecasting or a predictive analytics system that collects data, updates it, fits the model, monitors its performance and produces the desired output. Apply techniques and tools learned in the classroom: Python Jupyter notebook and other modules such as Pandas and Matplotlib, databases, cloud file storage, ML/AI models.

## Task
Where to buy a condo in Nashville, TN as an investment property? Objective is to find the neighborhood in the city that has the most potential for house price appreciation (net maintenance expenses such as fees and repairs). You can use any relevant economic data such as house price indices, household income, crime, demographics, school system reports, etc. Nashville has neighborhoods, such as Music Row and The Gulch, ideally your prediction should be for these, but you can use ZIP codes, MSA or similar divisions. The predictive model should use the most current data available. This kind of a project does not have a “true” value to compare with.
Alternatively, you can pick Austin, TX instead of Nashville.

## Data requirements
The time series used in a project are not obsolete and released by the issuers at regular schedule
In forecasting projects at least some regressors (explanatory variables) are available at higher frequency that the target series

## Midterm proposal
Present to the class your group project. Explain the objective of the project. **Present the exploratory data analysis** (EDA) of the dataset including the main candidate regressors. Convince the class that the project is not trivial, but also feasible. Reference the prior art. Present your modeling approach and project development plan/schedule. 

Note, this is the exploratory stage, and your finished system may look very different from what you thought and planned initially. However, you must demonstrate that you started working with the **data**, it’s a Data Science course after all!

### Deliverable: oral presentation and its PDF slide deck.
